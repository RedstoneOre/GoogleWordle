Revive creamy sauces the right way When warming up pasta or potatoes with creamy sauces, add a splash of milk or water to loosen the sauce and bring back that silky texture. Use low heat in a covered pan - it helps the sauce stay smooth and prevents it from drying out. 2. Schedule your prep day Treat meal prep like an appointment. Pick one day each week and make it part of your routine. 3. Start small If you’re new to meal prep, begin with 2-3 meals per week. Build consistency and test what flavours work best for you before going all in. Meal prep should always taste amazing. Something you genuinely look forward to eating every single day🤌🏽 Thank you all for the continued support. Keep cooking those meal preps!
